      </p>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        IIT Patna last three years' JEE Advanced cutoff data is available for
        Engineering and Architecture courses across various specialisations.
        Considering the last round closing rank cutoff over the past three
        years, BTech in CSE remains the most competitive branch among the
        General AI category students. On the contrary, B.Tech. in Computer
        Science and Engineering has lost its charm over the years, as the
        closing ranks have continuously increased. This indicates that the
        course is no longer in demand among the students.
      </p>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        Irrespective of the course choice, if someone wants to get into IIT
        Patna - Indian Institute of Technology, they can consider B.Tech. in
        Metallurgical and Materials Engineering + MBA (IIM Bodh Gaya), B.Tech.
        in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and Integrated B.Tech. in
        Civil Engineering + M.Tech. in Geotechnical Engineering as these courses
        are less competitive for students belonging to the General AI category.
      </p>
      <p style={pStyle}>
        Students belonging to the OBC category can consider B.Tech. in
        Metallurgical and Materials Engineering and B.Tech. in Economics if they
        are not eligible for competitive courses such as CSE, Electrical, etc.
        to secure admission at IIT Patna - Indian Institute of Technology.
